A speech recognition system is technology that translates spoken language into text or commands that a computer can understand. 
It works by analyzing the acoustic signals of speech, identifying patterns, and matching them to words or phrases in a language model. 
This technology is used in various applications, including virtual assistants, dictation software, and customer service bots.
